# malware-collection

This repository was created to make open and available to all audiences the possibility of performing malware analysis on different types of artifacts that can be located in all parts of our society.

In view of this, this repository is clearly intended for **studies**.


**DISCLAIMER**

As mentioned above, the purpose of this repository is to allow the study and analysis of malware, allowing people to have access to samples (samples) and perform static, behavioral and also code analysis, making it possible to create techniques for blocking, protecting and investigating these artifacts.

**THE MALWARE PROVIDED IN THIS REPOSITORY ARE ACTIVE!**

**DO NOT PERFORM THE EXECUTION UNLESS YOU ARE SURE AND HAVE EXPERIENCE IN MANIPULATING THEM, ALSO REMEMBERING THAT THIS REPOSITORY IS INTENDED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES!**

The recommendation is that it runs in a Virtual Machine and that it has no internet connection (or an internal virtual network, if necessary) and no guest additions or equivalents. Some samples will try to spread automatically and running them without restrictions means it will infect your environment and others with connections.

Default password for unzipping: **infected**
